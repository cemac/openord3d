OpenOrd3D extends the [OpenOrd layout algorithm of Shawn Martin et al.](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~smartin/software.html) into the third dimension.  [OpenOrd](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~smartin/software.html) is a very fast, approximate force-directed layout algorithm for very large graphs (up to millions of nodes/edges).  Inputs and outputs are tab-delimited text files, making it easy to wrap or adapt for any purpose.
